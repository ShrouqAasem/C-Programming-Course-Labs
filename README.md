# C Language Practice and Labs

Welcome to the C Language Practice and Labs repository! This repository contains solutions for practice tasks and labs completed as part of a C language course. 
Each directory corresponds to a specific task or lab.

## Practice Tasks
 
  
### Lab 1: Introduction to C Programming
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a c program to set the different format specifiers with "printf"
  2. Write a c program to read a character from the user and print it and its ASCII code.
  3. Write a c program to display the octal and the hexadecimal of an integer number.

 

### Lab 2: Operators and Control Statements
- **Tasks:**
  1. Receive numbers from the user, and exit when the sum exceeds 100. (lab1/task1_solution.c) 
  2. Simple Menu with 3 choices.  (lab1/task2_solution.c)
  3. Magic Box.
  4. Write a function takes 3 numbers as parameter, and returns the largest one among them... write a program to test it.
  5. Write a C Function that takes one character and checks if it alphabet or not.
  6. Write C Function that converts the any letter from lowercase to uppercase.
  7. Write a C Function that prints the cube of any number.
 

### Lab 3: 
- **Tasks:**
  1. C Program to swap 2 integer values. (Swap function, calling by address)
  2. Receive character by character and then place the string terminator upon pressing enter, then display the string.
  3. C Program to take char and displays if it is "Normal or Extended key" along with its Ascii value.

### Lab 4: 
- **Tasks:**
  1. C Program to take single Employee's information(ID, Name, Salary, Bonus, Deduction), and display his code, name along with his net salary. (Emp_Struct).
  2. C Program to take information of Array of 5 Employees, then display their data. (EmpArr_of_Struct).
  3. Employee with Functions (try to divide Ass#2 into 2 functions): struct Employee AddNewEmployee(); void DisplayEmployee(struct Employee).
  4. Employee with functions and Highlight Menu: Menu of Array_Of_Struct.
 

### Lab 5: 
- **Tasks:**
  1. C Program to take single Employee's information(ID, Name, Salary, Bonus, Deduction), and display his code, name along with his net salary. (Emp_Struct).
